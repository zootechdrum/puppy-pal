html{
    font-size: 62.5%;

//Where I put all of our resets or any other very
//gerneral styling that will apply to almost every element

    display: flex;

    margin: 0;

}
// The number 62.5% comes from the fact that a browser's default font-size is 16px. We want to make it so that 1rem = 10px. 
// That way we can easily use them as an alternative. 10/16 = 62.
